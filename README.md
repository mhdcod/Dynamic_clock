Dynamic Illuminated Clock
Project Overview
The Dynamic Illuminated Clock is a unique and interactive clock application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead of displaying time using numbers, this clock highlights specific words to represent the current time in a natural language format. The design is minimalistic and responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices.

Features
Real-Time Updates: The clock refreshes every minute to ensure the displayed time is always accurate.
Natural Language Display: Time is represented in words rather than numbers, making it intuitive and engaging.
Smooth Animations: Highlighted words transition smoothly to enhance the visual appeal.
Responsive Design: The clock is optimized to look great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
User-Friendly Interface: The simple and clean design makes it easy for anyone to read the time.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the clock interface.
CSS3: For styling and creating responsive layouts.
JavaScript (jQuery): For handling the logic behind time calculation and dynamic updates.

How It Works
The clock calculates the current hour and minute using JavaScript.
Based on the time, it determines which words should be highlighted to represent the time in natural language.
The clock automatically updates every minute to ensure accuracy.

Future Improvements:
Additional Languages: Add support for different languages by creating alternative word sets.
Enhanced Styling: Implement animations or transitions for a more dynamic visual effect.
