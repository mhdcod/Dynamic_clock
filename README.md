# Dynamic Word Clock-


This project is a dynamic word clock that displays the current time in a sentence-like format using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock updates every 5 minutes and highlights specific words to represent the time, offering a unique and visually appealing way to track time.

Features:
Real-Time Updates: The clock refreshes every 5 minutes to display the time.
Word-Based Display: The time is shown through highlighted words, creating a sentence-like representation.
Responsive Design: The clock is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
Customizable: You can easily modify the CSS to change the appearance of the clock.

Technologies Used: 
HTML5: Structure of the clock and word elements.
CSS3: Styling and layout, including the highlight effect.
JavaScript: Logic to calculate the current time and dynamically update the clock.

How It Works:
HTML Structure: The HTML file contains a series of <span> elements, each representing a word that can be highlighted to form the current time.
CSS Styling: The CSS file defines the layout and the styles for the highlighted words, giving the clock its distinctive look.
JavaScript Logic: The JavaScript code calculates the current hour and minute, then determines which words to highlight based on the time. It then adds a surbrillant class to the corresponding elements to highlight them.

Setup and Usage:
Clone the repository or download the files.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the clock.
To customize the clock, you can edit the CSS file (acceuil.css) or modify the JavaScript logic in main.js.

Customization
Colors and Styles: Modify the CSS to change the colors, font, and layout of the clock.
Time Format: Adjust the JavaScript logic if you want to display the time differently, such as using a 24-hour format.

Future Improvements:
Mobile Optimization: Further enhance the responsiveness for a better mobile experience.
Additional Languages: Add support for different languages by creating alternative word sets.
Enhanced Styling: Implement animations or transitions for a more dynamic visual effect.
